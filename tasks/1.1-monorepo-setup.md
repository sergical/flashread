# Task 1.1: Monorepo Setup

**Status:** completed  
**Phase:** 1 - Foundation  
**Blocking:** All other tasks  
**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

## Goal

Convert single-app extension into Turborepo monorepo with shared packages.

## Steps

- [x] Initialize pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- [x] Add Turborepo (`turbo.json`)
- [x] Create directory structure:
  ```
  apps/
    extension/    # Move existing extension here
    web/          # Will be created in Task 1.2
  packages/
    core/         # Extract shared libraries
  ```
- [x] Move extension files to `apps/extension/`
- [x] Extract to `packages/core/`:
  - `rsvp-engine.ts`
  - `text-processor.ts`
  - `orp.ts`
  - `types/index.ts`
  - `utils/constants.ts`
- [x] Update imports in extension to use `@flashread/core`
- [x] Update root `package.json` with workspace scripts
- [x] Verify `pnpm run build` works

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Extension builds from `apps/extension/`
- [x] Shared code importable from `@flashread/core`
- [x] `pnpm run dev` starts extension in watch mode

## Notes

- Keep `storage.ts` in extension (Chrome-specific APIs)
- Keep `packages/premium/` structure ready but empty (gitignored)
